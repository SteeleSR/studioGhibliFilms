# studioGhibliFilms
A JavaScript app which displays information about different Studio Ghibli films retrieved from ghibliAPI (https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/). 
I retrieved the data using a fetch request before using handlebars to output to the front-end. 
I tried to make the design as Studio Ghibli-like and ethereal as possible. I would like to continue to add functionality to the app and fully utilise the vast information available on the API to make an in-depth website for fans.
